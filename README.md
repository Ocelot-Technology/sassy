# Sassy
SaaS Platform meant to get started with a SaaS style product straight away. The goal is to take care of most of the boilerplate surrounding a SaaS and make it easier to actually build something awesome.

What this takes care of:
1) Basic front-end.
2) User Management

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

2. Run `npm install`.
3. Sign up for an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/).

5. run `npm start`.

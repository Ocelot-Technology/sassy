# Sassy
SaaS Platform meant to get started with a SaaS style product straight away. The goal is to take care of most of the boilerplate surrounding a SaaS and make it easier to actually build something awesome.

What this currently takes care of:
1) Basic front-end
2) User Management (Powered by Okta)

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Sign up for an [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/).
4. Make a copy of `sassy.config.js.example`, rename it to `sassy.config.js` and put real values in there for the secrets. See the file for more details on where to find each value.
5. run `npm start`.

See what you've got at `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Getting Started Continued...

There are example web apps for different front-end frameworks in branches in this repo. They have a basic web app setup so you can get started on your app asap, with as little friction as possible. Look at the following branches on the repo for details:

### Vue:

Look at branch `vue-example`.

### React: (WIP)
### Angular: (WIP)
